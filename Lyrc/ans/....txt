I've got shaky hands
After one night dreaming
Didn't fit my plans
To listen to your breathing
Down Maid Marian Way
Or Lenton Avenue
I don't know what to say
If I'm next to you
Must be a hybrid of places
A Roman theater raises
On English kind of weather
Next to the coast
I'm blending both together
The cities that mean to you the most
I'm standing on a hill
Until you come out from the mist
And then we
I'm standing on a hill
Until you come out from the mist
And then we kiss
Oh, it never felt so sane
I'm so confused
Oh, it feels like time for a change
But I don't need this to be known
I'm standing on a hill
Until you come out from the mist
And then we
I'm standing on a hill
Until you come out from the mist
And then we kiss
